# Udacity: Full Stack Developer Nanodegree
The goal of the Full Stack Web Developer Nanodegree program is to equip learners with the unique skills they need to build database-backed APIs and web applications. A graduate of this program will be able to design and build databases for software applications, create and deploy database-backed web APIs, and secure and manage user authentication and access control for an application backend. Students will also learn how to deploy a Flask-based web application to the cloud using Docker and Kubernetes.

## Projects
The projects folder contains the four projects I completed during this course.

#### [Project 1 -  SQL and Data Modeling for the Web](projects/01_fyyur)
Project to practice building models and model interactions to be able to store retrieve, and update data from a database.

#### [Project 2 -  Full Stack Trivia API](projects/02_trivia_api)
Project to practice structuring, planning, implementing, and testing an API.

#### [Project 3 - Authentication & Authorization Coffee Shop Menu](projects/03_coffee_shop_full_stack)
Project to practice authentication and authorization (with Roles Based Authentication using JWT and Auth0).

#### [Project 4 - Deploying a Flask API to AWS](../FSND-Deploy-Flask-App-to-Kubernetes-Using-EKS)
Project to practice containerizing and deploying a Flask API to a Kubernetes cluster using Docker, AWS EKS, CodePipeline, and CodeBuild.

## Tecnologies used (in order of appearance)
* Python3 and Flask as server language and server framework (mostly)
* PostgreSQL (and a little SQL Lite) as the database of choice
* SQLAlchemy ORM as ORM library
* Flask-Migrate for database migration
* virtualenv as a tool to create isolated Python environments
* Jinja for serverside templates and REACT, Vue.js, and Ionic for clientside applications
* Python unittests for API endpoint testing
* Node and NPM for some serverside stuff
* JWT & RBAC for authentication and authorization
* Auth0 as an auth service
* Postman for endpoint documentation and testing
* Docker
* Amazon Web Services (EKS (Kubernetes), CodePipeline, and CodeBuild)

and probably a few more
